# NetherGames Statistics Bot
### **Created by Melvin#5155**   


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot has been operational for over a year now.
It is very impressive on how many servers that this bot has reached.
It has been a blast working on this project.
But sadly everything that has a beginning will also have an ending.
The reason why I started this project is to learn more about Bot Development and APIs.
I didn't expect this bot to explode.
I only expected this bot to be in no more than 10 servers. 
Current life circumstances has led me to discontinue this project (I'm busy with school) that's the reason why there hasn't been any recent updates about the bot.
I'm sorry if this made you sad, if you have experiences in the field of Discord Bot Development with Discord.js then you can set up your own Discord Bot with the code provided in this github.
Thanks so much for the support, I hope you like my code :)
